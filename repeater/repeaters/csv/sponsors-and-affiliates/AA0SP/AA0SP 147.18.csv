Locations very close in to the Front Range, or in the shadow of Cheyenne Mountain are not covered well. Since this peak is shorter than Pikes Peak its coverage to the north is not as good as Pikes Peak, although there are points northeast of Colorado Springs where there is coverage.",AA0SP,E-power (solar).,This repeater is available for public service oriented communications with prior coordination.
