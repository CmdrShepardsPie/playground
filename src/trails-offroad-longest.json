The majority of the route will be on dirt roads, some are maintained, others aren't, quite a few trail sections, ATV and snowmobile trails and unmaintained overgrown old roads. The trail sections range from easy to more advanced technical sections, rocks, mud, water, and dirt. Steep rocky climbs and narrow passages through deep and overgrown woods make up some of the most challenging sections. Pin striping is unavoidable, body damage may be possible depending on skill level and set-up of your vehicle. Tall vehicles with rooftop tents will have a difficult time and will be forced to cut down some of the trees that have fallen across the trails and are learning overhead but haven't come all the way down. I personally did this entire route with an off-road trailer and managed to get through everything, although some stretches traversed ditches and streams that pose extreme approach and departure angles. A hitch with significant articulation is strongly recommended. You will require at least 2x 20L (5gal) fuel cans to do this trip as the first gas station along the route will be in the riverside town of Bath, which we didn't reach until the end of day 2. \r\n\r\n<b> Note: The .gpx file has additional than of those that are depicted below.

The only major obstacle is the Watson Wash drop-in which can be rutted and washed out.  In 2016 there was a washout south of Fort Piute, which currently requires you to use a <a href=\"https://www.trailsoffroad.com/trails/2160-mojave-road-2016-2017-washout-bypass\">bypass.</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Time on trail:</b>.  Allow a full three days to take in all the desert scenery, the side excursions and pick that perfect camp.  If you are short on time, you can drive some sections fairly quickly and make it in two days. \r\n\r\n<b>Caution:</b>  Wet weather could make this overland trail a real nightmare.

The scenery is only surpassed by the sense of self-reliance you will experience as you must carry everything you will need with you.   There's no gas, phones, electricity to rely on here.   However, there is a sprinkling of watering holes, wells and rock water tanks that you could rely on just like the pioneers did.   \n\nMany of these unfortunate travelers did not make it across the El Camino Del Diablo alive, You may encounter some of the hundreds of graves that are rumored to line the road during your trip.

      "route_description": "The Rimrocker Trail is a 160 mile trail that is an organization of mostly existing roads to form an off-pavement path which connects Montrose, Colorado to Moab, Utah.  In the writeup, I used the most common names for the roads, some roads had up to four different names for the same section of road/trail.\n\nBetween Montrose and Nucla, the roads that you travel are mainly graded dirt and gravel roads two vehicles wide that would be suitable for most vehicles.  Rain and snow could make the roads slick or impassable at times. Along this segment there are countless trail spurs on each side of the road. Logging trucks are active in this area so be alert for the trucks and machinery on the trail.  The terrain is a forest with a variety of trees and many options for camping.\n\nAs you approach Nucla, Colorado, you will move from dirt to pavement as you pass through the town and revert back to dirt.  \n\nDirectly west of Nucla, you will travel on rougher dirt roads where higher vehicle clearance and 4wd would be recommended.  These trails are mostly single vehicle width but there is almost always an area to easily pull over for faster moving traffic behind you or oncoming vehicles.  This is a desert terrain and you will find very few shade trees but many open ranges and cattle sharing the trail.  About halfway between Nucla and the Manti-La Sal National Forest you will come to the water crossing at Tabeguache Creek; this crossing is 12-20\" deep and is moving swiftly.  The trail continues to be rocky until the National Forest. \n\nIn the Manti-La Sal National Forest, the road is well graded and only has gravel, small rocks and some ruts and potholes after rain.  \n\nWhen you turn west off of the La Sal Pass (Waypoint 59), the trail becomes a double track through rocky and technical areas.  There are areas to pull over for oncoming traffic.  In some areas the trees close in on the trails and will brush along one or both sides of the vehicle.  There are tight corners, climbs and descents and larger rocks along the trail to navigate through.  As you get closer to the Moab area, the trail will become dirt with ruts and holes, eventually turning to pavement for the last section.\n\nFor more information on the Rimrocker Trail: [Montrose County Website](http://www.co.montrose.co.us/701/Rimrocker-Trail)",
      "highlights": "The Rimrocker Trail is a newly connected trail that allows you to enjoy 160 miles of off-pavement travel while experiencing the many different stunning landscapes that connect Montrose, Colorado to Moab, Utah.  The roads on the eastern half are graded gravel roads that are two vehicles wide and would easily be traveled in a family sedan.  It would be a fantastic destination to travel through the aspens during their fall color changes as well as stopping for the fantastic views at the overlooks.  Towards the west end of the trail, the Manti-La Sal National Forest provides beautiful scenery and wildlife as well as gorgeous views of the La Sal Mountains.  As you approach Moab, the landscape quickly turns from forest into desert as it transitions to some shelf roads built of the signature Moab red sand.",

      "route_description": "The Backway to Crown King is one of Phoenix's most popular trails. Situated in parts of the Prescott National Forest travelers will definitely get a taste of what this state has to offer for scenery. The beautiful part of this trail is that it can be as easy or as difficult as needed but 4x4 is still required. If you plan on trying any of the optional and more difficult lines your vehicle and your 4x4 prowess must be adequate. The trail begins as an easy dirt road following along the northern borders of the Lake Pleasant Regional Park and through some secluded residential areas. After turning onto the Crown King Trail at Waypoint 6, the adventure has started. Gradually climbing to an elevation of 6441 ft before dropping into the town of Crown King, this trail offers tight shelf roads, steep rocky climbs with shelves, seasonal water crossings, and blind corners so please be careful. It is also very important to note that there is private property along this trail. Please respect all private property signs. At Waypoint 18, the road was recently routed down into the creek to serve as an alternate route around a private mining claim. The creek bottom is rocky but depending on weather and the time of year, this creek may have water in it. As such, obstacles under the water are not easily seen so please take care through this section of the trail. Also, please respect the minersâ€™ wishes and do not enter into his property. It is also important to mention that in the winter months, depending on snow fall, the trail may not be passable. The snow can also create very dangerous situations on the narrow shelf roads. This is especially important after passing Waypoint 25. The descent past this point is on the north face of the mountain where ice and snow are the most treacherous. Please be prepared with the proper equipment, food, and water. Temperatures can also be very low so if you have to spend the night on the trail, please be prepared. If an overland adventure is what you are looking for, the Backway to Crown King can easily be connected to the [Senator Highway (FR 52)](https://www.trailsoffroad.com/trails/76-senator-highway-arizona) for a scenic trip to Prescott, Arizona. This trail is shared with all kinds of OHV users including: motorcycles, side by sides, quads, and 4x4's so please respect the rules of the road.  ",
      "highlights": "The highlight of the Backway to Crown King is the town itself and serves as a welcomed destination after a long day on the trail. Whether stopping for lunch or staying the night, it is well worth the time to check out the general store, saloon, and prospector mall. If you need supplies or a souvenir t-shirt, the general store is the place to go. It is also the place to go for Crown King's famous fudge. If you are looking for a cold adult beverage or a meal, check out the Crown King Saloon. Local musicians also frequent the saloon for good music. The Prospector Mall is also a great place to stop for supplies and a meal. Their breakfast is fantastic. There are also several cabins in the area that are available for travelers to spend the night.

Total mileage without gas is closer to 120 miles and that is without taking any of the side trails and spurs.  During the winter months, it is used my snowmobiles, and due to the location and elevation, the trail usually opens around the middle of July and ends in October due to snow.  The trail itself is completely accessible by 2wd high clearance vehicles as long as the weather permits.  It is a 1-2 vehicle wide trail with plenty of room to pass.  There are many areas of the trail that are shelf roads.  If you continue on some of the spurs such as the Burnt Knob Lookout, they are more difficult and require a 4wd high clearance vehicle.",

There is history at every corner with plenty of information along the way and available from the ranger districts at each end.  You can see first hand how a forest regrows after a burn, there have been many big forest fires over the past few decades that have swept through the area, and you get the chance to drive directly through that area.

      "highlights": "Almost 2000 miles of dirt road stretching across the United States from St. Joseph to San Francisco sounds like an overlanders dream come true. Dating back to 1860, The Pony Express was one of the most historic routes in the country. The trail was originally laid out to provide a way for mail to be delivered. Over the course of eight to ten days, riders would traverse mountains and deserts across 8 states (Only two states back then) to deliver mail to Sacramento, where it was placed onto a steamer to continue its journey to San Francisco. At its peak, there were believed to be around 190 stations spanning across this historic route. Sadly after only 18 months, the telegraph was brought about and lead to the termination of The Pony Express in October of 1861. Today, much of the track is still available and maintained by the Bureau of Land Management. What took riders eight to ten days to cover at an average speed of seven miles per hour now can be achieved by vehicle in as little as 5 hours depending on speed of travel. Billboards and postings give plenty of information along this trail. Although it may be a maintained route, be sure to pack for desert travel bringing plenty of food, water, and clothing in the colder months. ",

Drive and ride only on roads and trails where such travel is allowed; hike only on established trails, on rock, or in washes. Camp at designated sites or, where allowed, at previously used sites. Avoid placing tents on top of vegetation and use a camp stove instead of making a campfire. Unless signs indicate otherwise, leave gates open or closed as you find them.\r\n\r\nHelp keep Canyon Country clean. <b>Pack out your trash</b> and recycle it, clean up after less thoughtful visitors, and dispose of human waste properly.\r\n\r\nProtect and conserve scarce desert water sources. Camp at least 300 feet from isolated water sources to allow for wildlife access. Where possible, carry your own drinking water. Leave potholes undisturbed and wash well away from pools and springs.\r\n\r\nAllow space for wildlife. When encountering wildlife, maintain your distance and remain quiet. Teach children not to chase or pick up animals. Keep pets under control.\r\n\r\nLeave historic sites, Native American rock art ruins and artifacts untouched for the future. Admire rock art from a distance and never touch it. Stay out of ruins, leave artifacts in place, and report violations.\r\n",

It can be driven in either direction but this report is written with the starting point at Ballarat, CA.  The trail travels eastward from the Ballarat ghost town through Pleasant Canyon, swings south through Middle Park, and then back west through South Park Canyon.  The west sides of the trail are in the BLM and the east sides are in Death Valley National Park.  There are no sign posts along the trail stating where the borders lie.  The trail is rated easy to moderate with a few sections requiring 4WD (Roger's Pass, Chicken Rock, South Park Canyon).  There is a 3-ton limit wooden bridge in South Park Canyon that is sometimes closed.  If so, signs may be posted on both ends of the bridge and travelers are required to turn around and head back the way they came.  ",
      "highlights": "For the overlander who truly wants to explore the best of Death Valley, the Pleasant Canyon loop trail offers a little bit of everything.  Mines, cabins, steep mountain ascents and descents, epic views, rocks, cliffs, wood bridges, and more.  The loop begins and ends in the Panamint Valley and explores Pleasant Canyon, Middle Park, and South Park.  Some of the many sites to visit are Claire Camp, World Beater Mine Cabin, Cooper Mine, Mormon Gulch, Rita's Cabin, Roger's Pass, Chicken Rock (see photo), Chicken Bridge, and Briggs Cabin.  Chicken Rock is a downward-tilting, narrow section of the trail which tips your vehicle precariously towards a 200' vertical drop.  Once past this obstacle, you face the famous 3-ton limit wooden bridge before descending back into the Panamint Valley to complete the loop.  ",

Some of best cabins along this route include the World Beater Mine Cabin (shown here) and Briggs Cabin.  Both of these cabins are noted in the GPS track and photos are shown.  Within the BLM, dispersed backcountry camping is allowed as long as (1) the campsite is at least one mile away from any paved road or \"day use only\" dirt road and (2) the campsite is only in previously disturbed areas.  You must park your vehicle immediately adjacent to the roadway to minimize impact. The wilderness boundary is 50 feet from the center of most dirt roads.  Campfires are prohibited, except in fire pits in developed campgrounds. Gathering wood is unlawful and burning of wood is not allowed in the backcountry.  Camp stoves and propane grills are allowed in all areas.  ",

(1-2)  You will travel over mostly flat prairie land through a sprinkling of historic ranches until you finally drop down into Hooker Hot Springs Canyon and the Muleshoe Ranch.    From the sign-in entry kiosk, the road ahead becomes rougher and requires at least a high clearance vehicle.    There are seven year-round running streams in these canyons, and you will cross one in the bottom of Bass Canyon.   \r\n\r\nFor the first portions of the climbs up out of the canyon,  some enterprising rancher used concrete to fortify the road.   These come in handy for several hill climbs/descents as the concrete is scored to aid with traction.  \r\n\r\nThe road continues up and over hills, and across broad open flat areas as you skirt the foothills of the Galiuro Mountains.  \r\n\r\nOnce you reach the Redfield Wilderness area, the road condition degrades considerably and there will be portions requiring 4 wheel drive low to traverse comfortably. You will encounter steps, off camber hill climbs and descents, and a few rocky sections that will require good traction.  The last half mile is the most challenging of all,(5) requiring the navigation of a shelf road that descends sharply into Jackson Canyon at the end of the trail.  This part of the trail  has big rocky sections to climb over, off camber sections and long drop-offs on the north side of the road.   Once at the bottom of this seemingly endless hill, you will cross the rocky creek and be at the cabin.  ",
      "highlights": "Jackson Cabin / Muleshoe Road is one of those iconic trails for which the reward of the journey rivals that of the destination.   The Nature Conservancy maintains the riparian areas at the beginning of the trail and has graciously allowed access to these wonders.   You will see amazing views of rock cliff faces, mountain vistas, desert springs, seeps and abundant plant life where springs have pushed up from below nourishing abundant wildlife such as coatimundi, deer, javelina, and a wide variety of watchable bird life.   \r\n\r\nThe views of the rhyolite rock formations along the western face of the Galiuro Mountains could very well challenge the scenery experienced in the canyon country of southern Utah.   The start of this trail is about 110 miles from Tucson.  It's a long day to get to the end but it's certainly worth it for the payoff is a 100-plus-year-old cabin, teeming with history.    Bring your tent, bring your camp stove,  bring your ice chest because this is a fabulous place to turn into an overnight adventure.    In fact,  the position of the sun on the way in (afternoon setting reds) and the way out (morning freshness) completely changes the views and makes this almost two different trips.\r\n",

The lower Sonoran Desert is at its best at sunrise, all peace and stillness, and beauty.\n\nThe Palomas Harquahala Road crosses the expansive Palomas Plain to the Clanton Hills, traces the western edge of the Eagletail  Mountains Wilderness, parallels sandy Deadman Wash up into Nottbusch Valley, and skirts the western edge of Cemetary Ridge before passing in the shadow of Deadman Mountain.  The names alone bespeak adventure.   The trail cuts through a flat desert sea of creosote bush, bursage, and brittlebush.  The sameness is broken here and there by saguaro and ocotillo.   Like green ribbons, the washes snake through the desert with their overgrown banks of palo verde, mesquite, and ironwood.  Corrals and windmills, many still in use, evoke an earlier time when rugged men came here to eke out a living in this arid landscape.

      "route_description": "This is a very diverse offroad trail in which you encounter many types of terrain throughout its entirety. From the start, it will be a sandy/hard pack dirt road while you cross the East Fork of the Virgin River near two dozen times. Each of the crossings varies in drop height, softness of sand, and water depth. The majority of the year, the crossing will be passible although always measure the depth of the water and check the current before crossing. Much of the trail is shaded so snow may be present at times, and the river does freeze in spots so breaking ice may be necessary in the colder months. After your final water crossing, you are faced with the difficult sand hill. This hill is incredibly steep and has a hill off of your driver's side. **Do not attempt if you do not feel comfortable.** Airing down your tires and maintaining momentum are the only way you will have a chance of making it up this hill. After you have made it to the top, you will continue on a sandy road with occasional sections of solid rock. Once you reach the end of the Parunuweap Canyon Wilderness Study Area at Waypoint 27, the trail becomes a little more hard pack and less difficult. After Waypoint 34, there will be sections of very soft sand, but it will be on level ground or just a slight hill. The upper portion of this trail beyond Waypoint 34 has a completely different feel to it. The dirt turns white, the trees grow larger, and there is likely a breeze present. The higher elevations and shaded spots will likely keep snow longer than the lower parts of the trail. If you do want to run this trail, consider running it in reverse of this guide, as the hardest part you will then be running downhill. Still attempt with extreme caution. In wet conditions, only two spots on the trail will become slick: Waypoint 20 and Waypoint 23.  \n\nPlease remember, this guide was written during low water levels. Higher water will make The Barracks Trail significantly more difficult, if not impossible. Please practice caution when attempting any water crossing. \n\nFor current river flows, please check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ut/nwis/uv/?site_no=09404450&PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060,62614,00010,00095,00400,00300,00045\">USGS River Flows</a>.",

Luckily, this trail is easily accessible off of Highway 89 from both ends and can be enjoyed by all; even if you decide to avoid the hill and turn back the way you came in. If you are passing through on your way to Kanab or just looking for a new trail to explore, make sure this one is on your list!",

None of these optional routes are very long and all lead back to the main fire road. While none of these routes are \"extreme\" they are definitely difficult. Due to a recent Wildlife Rehabilitation most of the optional trails on the west end of the trail are now closed. So, for this reason we recommend traveling East to West for a more entertaining day. \r\n\r\nCleghorn is very popular for the Dirtbike, ATV, and UTV crowd so, please, keep an eye out for them on the trail as there are lots of blind switch back turns. Passing areas are not an issue however and most of the trail is wide enough for two way traffic. ",

Nearby food, gas, and camping make this an ideal trip for a family weekend.

You have to work to get here.   It is one of Arizona's most remote and unvisited landscapes.\n\nForest Road 82 is called Anderson Mesa Road by the locals.  Anglers and weekend ATV riders use the ends of this southern stretch to reach Long Lake and Kinnikinnick Lake.  The lakes, even modest Cow Lake, are wonders in their own right.  Elk, pronghorn and sometimes eagles are drawn to their reliable water sources.  \n\nThe rough, rocky, suspension crunching middle section seldom sees anyone save a few lonesome ranch hands or extremely dedicated hunters.  The tan savannah grasslands periodically give way to thick juniper forests forcing the trail to twist, split, merge and meander its way through before opening again to another broad vista.  A sudden outcropping of rough boulders forces you to choose a line.  It is more likely that you see a dozen elk racing across the two-track in front of you than running across another human.\n\nBut adventure begins where easy ends.  Go see for yourself.",

Bloody Basin Road offers visitors a chance to access this very unique region where Native American ruins are found right next to old stone cabins of the early settlers. With a name like Bloody Basin you would expect it to have a past littered with conflict. One of the most familiar conflicts occurred in 1873 when it was suspected that a group of Apache's killed 3 men. Army Captain George Randall tracked them to Turret Peak where  the army stormed the camp at night and in the panic, some Indians jumped from the cliffs to their deaths. When the battle was over, 26 Apaches were dead. \r\nBloody Basin is also home to the Horseshoe Ranch, which was founded in 1882 by William Mitchell. It would eventually become one of the largest cattle ranches in Arizona. At one time, the ranchâ€™s cattle ranged over an area of 30 square miles. Cattle grazing still takes place in the area, but most of the original property is now part of Aqua Fria National Monument. The area is large, give yourself the entire day to explore this unique part of the southwest. The numerous side trails offer countless points to walk among the ruins and search the nearby rocks for petroglyphs. There are hundreds of examples of this ancient art work littering the monument region. Look along cliffs or even on stray rocks in the meadows. Please do not disturb or alter these precious artifacts to ensure they remain for generations to come.  ",
      "camping_and_lodging": "Campgrounds are dispersed throughout the entirety of the Bloody Basin Road. With the best being found later along the route where there are shade trees. At the end near the Verde River and Sheep's Bridge are the best camping spots but are very remote. The camping throughout the entire region is primitive and there are no services. There are very few trees in the region, so it is highly recommended that you bring firewood to help preserve what little tree coverage that's left.",

While there are no major obstacles to be worried about on this trail, it is long and some of it is rough and worth airing down to make the day a little less bumpy.\n\nAt the start of the trail, you will run into lots of rocky sections, boulders and some rocks to climb up. The intersection at Poughkeepsie Gulch is completely rock and can be VERY slick if itâ€™s wet for any reason and snow can be downright treacherous.  There are multiple areas of shelf road on both sides of the vehicle. Be prepared for these drop offs and always remember that uphill traffic traditionally has the right of way.\n\nThis trail travels well above the timberline and much if it is fragile alpine tundra. Itâ€™s extremely important that travelers follow the trail and do not deviate from it. The damage one vehicle can do by going off-trail can take years for the area to recover.\n\nSince this trail falls into the iconic category, itâ€™s traveled by lots of people every year. Because it is one of the easier trails in the San Juans, it is a popular trail for both experienced drivers and people out for the weekend with rented Jeeps and ATVâ€™s.\n\nLarge SUVâ€™s are going to have trouble maneuvering on a trail like this in places, but just about any vehicle with clearance can make this trail if they take their time. \n\n<b>To run the Alpine Loop in itâ€™s traditional route, start in the town of Lake City. Go south and begin the loop at <a href=\"https://www.trailsoffroad.com/trails/258-cinnamon-pass\">Cinnamon Pass</a>. When you get to <a href=\"https://www.trailsoffroad.com/trails/258-cinnamon-pass#waypoint_28179\">waypoint 20 on Cinnamon Pass</a>, turn right (north) and head uphill towards <a href=\"https://www.trailsoffroad.com/trails/290-engineer-pass\">Engineer Pass</a>. After 2.1 Miles the <a href=\"https://www.trailsoffroad.com/trails/2739-engineer-pass-alpine-loop-connector\">Engineer Pass - Alpine Loop Connector</a> ends, turn right (east) to pick up <a href=\"https://www.trailsoffroad.com/trails/290-engineer-pass#waypoint_27916\">Engineer Pass at waypoint 11</a> back towards Lake City.</b>",
      "highlights": "In the late 1800â€™s, miners started digging for gold, silver, lead and other ore in the San Juan Mountains. They needed a way to get people and the ore out to the nearby towns. Those roads left by the long-abandoned mines are now some of the most famous off-road trails in the books. Engineer Pass is one of them and is part of a trail now known as the Alpine Loop.\n\nThis part of the Alpine Loop starts in two places actually. This trail as written here starts near the city of Ouray, CO and goes almost 30 miles to Lake City, CO. If you are running Engineer Pass as <b>part</b> of the Alpine Loop, then read up on <a href=\"https://www.trailsoffroad.com/trails/258-cinnamon-pass\">Cinnamon Pass</a>, and the Engineer Pass/Alpine Loop Connector and you will start Engineer Pass at waypoint 11 on this guide. Regardless of where you start this trail you get a chance to test your skills, explore the backcountry and old mining towns of Colorado, and even touch the skies along the way.\n\nThere are multiple mine ruins to view and explore the grounds of along the way including the Hard Tack Mine and the Michael Breen Mine. Some are marked clearly and some are not. You should not enter structures or disturb the area in any way, but what you can see from afar is well worth the stop at these historic places.\n\nIf youâ€™re looking for scenery, then you'll find spots all along the trail worth stopping for. Mile after mile provides new and more amazing views of Colorado and the San Juan mountains. Oh Point and the official summit have breath-taking panoramas of the mountains. Each stop gives you another sweeping vista and you can spend a whole day just taking in the views.\n\nThose looking for altitude will find that this trail goes well above the timberline at just over 12,900â€™. With the altitude comes stunning views of the mountains to the north including the Uncompahgre, Coxcomb, Wetterhorn and Wildhorse mountain peaks. The view is so expansive at Oh Point that on a very clear day, you might be able to see all the way to Utah if you turn your eyes to the west.\n\nThis trail is relatively easy and for everyone from the beginner to the experienced. It offers something for the whole family along the way. While this trail isnâ€™t rough, it is a true off-road trail and will test your fortitude with shelf roads and some of the early rocks and obstacles.\n\nFor Jeep owners, thereâ€™s a special note here. Jeep has designated some trails as <a href=\"https://www.jeep.com/en/badge-of-honor/#home\">Badge of Honor</a> trails and this is one of the few in Colorado. Its fame means that Jeep will recognize if you ran it and provide you with a badge to put on your rig showing you completed the trail.",
      "camping_and_lodging": "Dispersed camping is allowed, though trailsoffroad did not observe that many camp-rings since camping above the timberline can be rough. Mind fire notices and a 14 day limit on camping in one spot if you decide to stay along trail.\r\n\r\nThere are campgrounds near the trailhead including <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/recreationalAreaDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=262244&facilityId=262244&agencyCode=70903\">Angel Creek Campground</a> and <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/amphitheater-co/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=70572\">Ampitheater Campground</a>. One of the largest and busiest campgrounds in the area is the first come, first serve <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sanjuan/recarea/?recid=43238\">Mill Creek Campground</a>. You have to make reservations or get there early if you want to camp this near to the trail. The peak of the season means that the campsites fill up <b>fast</b>.",
